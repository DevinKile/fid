<h1>Who Are We? Nah, Who Are You?</h1>
<p>We are a couple of black male nerds who felt the need to open up our own comic shop and represent for the people of color
that are not highlighted enough in the comic book, anime, television, movie, or video game industry. Come on in and bask in all 
the melanin! Toys coming soon!</p>
